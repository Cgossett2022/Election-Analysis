# Election-Analysis

## Overview

For this project, we are helping Tom conduct an Election Audit for the Colorado Board of Elections. Through the use of Python and VS Code, we are able to help Tom evaluate the following: how many votes were cast, number of votes per county, number of votes per candidate, and winning candidate.

## Election-Audit-Summary

I would encourage the Election Commission to use this script in future audits. It is capable of iterrating through large sets of data and it eliminates the manual proceess of tallying up all the votes.

While it is currently set to evaluate number of votes per candidate and per county, additional values could be added to the CSV file such as "City" or "Ballot Type". This would allow the Election Commission to peform similar analysis using different fields.
